# Simple platformer engine.

2D platformer engine using C++, based on [Basic 2D Platformer Physics tutorials](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/basic-2d-platformer-physics--cms-998).
Currently built on top of [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) for simplicity, and will be refactored and port to [Oryol](https://github.com/floooh/oryol) later for production use.

## Difference from the tutorial

The project is designed for my next metroidvania game and won't align with the tutorial.
Let's see what it'll look like after used in a serious indie game.

## Status

[x] Basic map collision
[x] Character movement
